# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in an individual based on medical input features.

## 🔍 Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes. This application uses a trained machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical parameters.

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease), which includes the following features:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (cp)
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
- Serum Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl (fbs)
- Resting ECG Results (restecg)
- Max Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
- Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
- ST Depression (oldpeak)
- Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)
- Number of Major Vessels (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit  (for web app)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

## 📦 Installation
